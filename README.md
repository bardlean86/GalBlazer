  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>GalBlazer is a vertical scrolling SHOOT-EM-UP with several power-ups that you can obtain, as well as an endless supply of enemies to destroy. As you blow up enemy ships, the numbers will increase each wave.

The art direction and style is based heavily off of retro shooter games from the SNES/TurboGraphix era.

All sprites, music, and sound fx are original creations. The game is programmed in Python using the Pygame libraries (which is essentially an SDL wrapper) and Python 3.4.<p>
